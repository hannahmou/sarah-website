                    had managed club Instagram accounts before, but that was
                    back in high school with relatively new clubs that had
                    around 100 followers. Blueprint, on the other hand, was a
                    well-established organization with chapters across the
                    country and over 1,000 followers—more than ten times the
                    size of any account I had previously handled. The increased
                    responsibility was daunting at first, but I used that
                    pressure as motivation. It was a fantastic experience, and
                    I’m truly thankful for the opportunity. Thank you!
