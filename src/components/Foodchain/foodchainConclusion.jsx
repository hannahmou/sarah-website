                    As part of my application for Blockchain @ Berkeley, I was
                    tasked with coming up and designing an application that
                    utilizes blockchain as a solution to a social problem. Prior
                    to this project ,I wasn't familiar with blockchain
                    technology or even mobile development and design. I felt
                    both intimidated and excited to venture into these new
                    fields. However, despite my initial apprehensions, I am very
                    pleased with how the project turned out, and it has sparked
                    my enthusiasm for UI/UX design in the future.
