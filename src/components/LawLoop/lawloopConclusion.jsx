                    There was so much to learn from this project. With the help
                    of my teammate, Oleg, we are in the process of coding up the
                    website using CSS, HTML, and React. It was such a learning
                    process not only learning how to code and develop front end
                    for the first time, but learning the limitations of my
                    designs with front end development. I had so many ideas and
                    imaginations of how the website would look, but actually
                    attempting to code it was an entirely different story. I had
                    to make compromises, all the while finding new tools and
                    tips from sources everywhere, inspiring me in different
                    ways. It was so much fun to make this project, and I am so
                    excited for future front-end development projects to come!
                    Thank you!
