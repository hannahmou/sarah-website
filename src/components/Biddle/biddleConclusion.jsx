                    Typically, my design process begins with addressing problems
                    I face personally, using my own experiences as a foundation
                    for creating solutions. This approach allows me to deeply
                    understand the pain points and challenges, leading to
                    intuitive and effective designs. However, this project
                    presented a unique opportunity to step outside of my own
                    experiences and focus entirely on the needs of others, as I
                    am not a part of the Greek community at my school.

                This shift in focus was both challenging and rewarding. It
                pushed me to consider design elements that I might not have
                thought of if I were designing for myself. It also reinforced
                the importance of user-centered design, where the ultimate goal
                is to create a solution that is seamless, intuitive, and
                genuinely beneficial for the people who will use it. Through
                this experience, I gained valuable insights into how to design
                effectively for others, enhancing my ability to create solutions
                that address a broader range of problems beyond my own. Thank
                you!
