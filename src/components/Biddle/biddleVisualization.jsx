                    Rather than sticking with a list view, which runs into
                    problems of readability and comprehension, I thought a
                    better idea would be to utilize a card view for
                    interactivity and clarity.

                With a list or table view, often times, hierarchy is difficult
                to achieveâ€”especially with a large amount of information needed
                to be communicated.

                            However, with a card view, it offered a lot more
                            space to play around with text weight, icons, and
                            size to ensure easy comprehension,{' '}
