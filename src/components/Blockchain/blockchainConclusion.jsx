                    As a member of the marketing team, I was responsible for
                    assisting with the design and planning of social media
                    posts, as well as creating the flyer to be distributed at
                    tabling and club events. It was highly rewarding to
                    contribute to the club that Iâ€™ve been a part of and to play
                    a role in others' recruitment experiences. Throughout the
                    recruitment process, I received numerous compliments on my
                    work, with many people expressing that their interest in the
                    club stemmed from the flyer I designed. I really look
                    forward to the future work I do with B@B! Thank you!
