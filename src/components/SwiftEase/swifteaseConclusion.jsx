                        As a Swiftie and having recently attended the Eras Tour,
                        I was thrilled to dive into this project. I had a
                        firsthand understanding of the problem and eagerly
                        embraced the challenge. Given Taylor’s use of inside
                        jokes and references in her songs, I wanted my redesign
                        to capture that same spirit and personality. This
                        project was both fun and educational, as it required me
                        to creatively condense a lot of information into a small
                        space while staying true to the theme.
                    </div>
                    <br></br> As a result, this project not only allowed me to
                    combine my passion for Taylor’s music with my design skills,
                    but also helped me grow as a designer, learning to balance
                    creativity with functionality in a meaningful way. Thank
                    you!
