                    This project was my first real time focusing on the user
                    experience aspect of UI/UX design. I learned a ton about
                    prioritizing user flow, research, and functionality.
                    Additionally, it was my first time collaborating with a
                    design team rather than working solo. Balancing different
                    opinions and managing my own ideas with others was a new
                    experience that taught me a lot about effective teamwork and
                    collaboration in the design process. Thank you!
